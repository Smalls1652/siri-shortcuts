## Setup

By default, there should be three questions asked when importing this shortcut:

- What’s the name of your pet?
- What type of pet is it?
	- **Note** - This only works with Dog or Cat as an answer and only randomly adds their respective sound to the output of the shortcut.
- What is their birth date?

### Suggested actions after setup

After you import the shortcut, change the name of the shortcut to match your pet’s name.

For example:
If your pet’s name is “Dingleberry”, change the name of the shortcut to “How old is Dingleberry?”. This will let you ask Siri directly by their name.
